# Train Your Own Model
> This project aims at enabling end users train a custom classification model without coding skills required.

Though machine learning tehnology has penetrated everyone's life in recent years, 
approximately [0.5%](https://www.future-processing.com/blog/how-many-developers-are-there-in-the-world-in-2019)
of population know how to code, not to mention how to train a neural network. 
A smart camera system is designed here which consists of [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/),
in combination with [Google Coral TPU](https://coral.ai/products/accelerator/) with the support of
[Google Cloud AutoML Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/docs/tutorial#tutorial-vision-dataset-python)
using python.
